# RowdyRunner- Special Edition (SE)
## What's New
RowdyRunner - Special Edition has all the usual bells and whistles of the previous release, but I've added some additional functionality, which adds more levels with a few small tweaks to make it unique.

## About
RowdyRunner is a Java-based program that takes the best elements of a classic top-down video game and mixes it with a fresh set of modern graphics. Join Rowdy, the fastest roadrunner on the planet, as he runs, dodges, and flies through some of the world's most toughest obstacles and levels! We hope you enjoy our take on a classic video game.

## Specifications
  RowdyRunner's source code applies advanced techniques to help render graphics by taking advantage of classes like Canvas and Swing. To help visual stability, our team incorporated a double-buffering technique to help render a seamless graphical experience, and with the utilization of spritesheets, we were able to reduce the memory overhead of the game. Further more, our source code takes full advantage of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) scheme, which separates the code's tasks in a more organized way.<br/><br/>
Executables Include: RowdyRunnerSE.jar (Universal) and RowdyRunnerSE.app (macOS)
